                    <h2>What is PHRASAL VERB???</h2>
                    <p>Phrasal verb is a verb that combined with an adverb or preposition. Many phrasal verbs gave more one meaning. Sometimes the meaning of phrasal verb is very similar to the base verbs, and the adverb just emphasizes the meaning of the base verb. <br>Phrasal verb is a verb like pick up, turn on or get on with. These verbs consist of a basic verb + another word or words. The two or three words that make up a phrasal verb form a short "phrase" - which is why we call them "phrasal verbs". But a phrasal verb is still a verb. Look is a verb. Look up is also a verb - a different verb. They do not have the same meaning, and they behave differently grammatically. You should treat each phrasal verb as a separate verb, and learn it like any other verb. Look at these examples. You can see that there are three types of phrasal verb formed from a single-word.</p>
                    <p>Phrasal verbs consist of a verb and a preposition or an adverb:</p>

                    <p>Sometimes phrasal verbs consist of three elements:</p>

                    <P>When added to the verb the preposition or adverb may change completely the meaning of the verb.<br>Here are some examples:</P>

                    <h3>These phrasal verbs can be transitive and intransitive: </h3>
                    <P><b>a.	Transitive</b><br>
                        The same meaning of transitive and intransitive applies to phrasal verbs in the same way as it does to normal verbs. A transitive phrasal verb takes an object. For example: Hang up your jacket. <br>
                            When a phrasal verb is transitive, it’s possible to put the object between the verb and the adverb/preposition, or put it afterwards. There is no difference in meaning. For example: Take off your jacket or Take your jacket off.<br>
                        
                        b	Intransitive <br>
                        Intransitive  phrasal verbs are easier to use because there is no object to worry about. Here are some examples of intransitive phrasal verbs: <br>
                        •	The plane took off and landed on time. (left the ground) <br>
                        •	Where did you grow up? – In a small town just outside this city. (live your childhood)<br> 
                        •	This car is terrible. It breaks down all the time! (stops working) <br>
                        •	You’re doing really well, so carry on like this. (continue) <br>
                        •	He started a university course but dropped out after one year. (left/stop participating) <br>
                        •	Pete and Sue had an argument but they’ve made up now. (reconcile) <br>
                        •	Did you get the tickets? No, they’d sold out. (sell all those available) <br></P>
                        
                        <h4>The Meaning Of Phrasal Verbs</h4>
                        <p> Sometimes, it is difficult to understand the meaning of phrasal verbs. Before looking them up in a dictionary, it would be helpful to use the context to understand them. <br>
                            <b> Literal meaning</b> <br>
                            Some phrasal verbs have a literal meaning. They can be easily 	understood. <br>
                        o	She opened the door and looked outside. <br>
                        o	She was walking across the street when she heard the sound of an explosion. <br>
                        
                             <b>Idiomatic meaning </b><br>
                                Phrasal verbs can also have a figurative or idiomatic meaning which makes them difficult to understand. <br>
                        o	Can you put me up for tonight? The phrasal verb 'put up' here does not 	mean to build (as in putting a fence up). It has, however, an 	idiomatic/figurative meaning. It means to let someone stay in your 	house. <br>
                        
                        <h4>Separable Or Inseparable? </h4>
                        1.	Sometimes, the preposition/adverb is placed either after the verb or after the \object. <br>
                        Examples: <br>
                        •	Mary made up a really entertaining story. <br>
                        
                        2.	If the object is a pronoun, however, the preposition/adverb has to be placed after the pronoun (object).<br>
                        Examples: <br>
                        •	She made it up. <br>
                        •	Put it down. <br>
                        3.	Some phrasal verbs are always inseparable. <br>
                        Example: <br>
                        •	I came across some old photos in a drawer. <br>
                        <b>NOT</b> <br>
                        •	I came some old photos across in a drawer.<br>
                        </P>
