                <h2>Affixations</h2>
                <p>Have you ever heard words like disagree, brotherhood, handsful, etc.? These words have affixes or word parts that are placed at the beginning, middle, and end of the original word! These are commonly known as affixes. What are affixes, and how do they form? Let's discuss together.</p>

                        <h2>What is affixes???</h2>
                <p>In English grammar and morphology, affixation is the process of adding a morpheme—or affix—to a word to create either a different form of that word or a new word with a different meaning; affixation is the most common way of making new words in English.
                <br>The two primary kinds of affixation are prefixation, the addition of a prefix, and suffixation, the addition of a suffix, while clusters of affixes can be used to form complex words. A large majority of new words in the English language today are either a result of blending—mashing two words or partial words together to form a new one—or affixation.</br></p>
                <h3>a. Negation or opposition</h3>
                <p>Negative statements are the opposite of positive statements. To make a negative statement, we can add a prefix that has negative meaning to the base of the word. The base of the word can be a noun, adjective, or verb.<br>
                    <b>For example:</b> She looks happy at this home. This is a sentence with positive meaning. We can change the meaning of the sentence into negative by adding a prefix un- to the adjective happy.
                </br></p>
                <u><b> Prefix un- </b></u>
                <p>Examples:<br>
                    •	Known – Unknown<br>
                        She met unknown person at the office yesterday<br>
                    •	Do – Undo<br>
                        You can undo the process if you are not sure.<br>
                    •	Lock – Unlock<br>

                                        Suffixes are also the kind of affixation. It is a letter or a goup of letters that is placed at the end of a word to create a new word. Suffixes usually change the word class from the base form.<br>
                                        For example: He is the best actor of this year.<br>
                                         The word actor in the sentence has suffix –or. It comes from act (verb). After we add suffix –or at the end of the verb act, the word class is changed into a noun. The word classes that can be formed by adding suffixes are noun, adjective, verb,and adverb
                                        </p>
